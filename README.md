# URL Shortener API 

What the application does:

> Users can submit a full length URL in a textbox to generate a short numeric URL.

> Users can see a list of URLs (Original URL, Short URL, Delete Button).

> Users can delete a URL from the list.

> Users can see flash messages when a URL is added or deleted.

> Submitting an invalid URL that doesn't follow the https://www.example.com format gives an error message.


To get it up and running:

> Create a MongoDB database on MongoDB Atlas

> Clone this git repository

> Install dependencies: npm install

> Create .env file in the root folder and add the MONGO_URI environment variable following the steps in MongoDB Atlas.

> Run server: node server.js
